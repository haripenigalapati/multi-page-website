                   <h1>WHAT WE LOVE TO DO</h1>
                   <p>A smile costs nothing, but gives much.
        
                        It enriches those who receive, without making poorer those who give.
                
                        It takes a moment, but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.
                
                        None is so rich or mighty that he can get along without it, and none is so poor, but that he can be made rich by it.
                
                        A smile creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in business, and is the countersign of friendship.
                
                        It brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and it is nature’s best antidote for trouble.
                
                        Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone, until it is given away.
                
                        Some people are too tired to give you a smile;
                
                        Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give.
